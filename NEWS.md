### Introducing itscalledsoccer ‚öΩ üéâ 

This is the first release of `itscalledsoccer`, a wrapper around the same API that powers the [American Soccer Analysis app](https://app.americansocceranalysis.com/). It enables R users to programmatically retrieve advanced analytics for their favorite players and teams, with coverage of the following competitions: 

- Major League Soccer
- National Women's Soccer League
- USL Championship
- USL League One
- MLS NEXT Pro
- North American Soccer League (defunct)

We at ASA, have been working on this for the better part of 6 months and are super excited to release it. We hope it makes interacting with our data easier and allows people to build new and informative things.

### Bug fixes üêõ 

None, but if you do find a bug while using the package, please submit an [issue](https://github.com/American-Soccer-Analysis/itscalledsoccer/issues).

### Documentation üìö 

We know our documentation is a bit sparse at the moment, but we plan on building it up and adding more examples over time. In the meantime, [the API documentation](https://app.americansocceranalysis.com/api/v1/__docs__/) should be a sufficient stop gap for specific functions.

Happy soccering!
